This directory contains the result of running 'fetcher' against a properly
filled directory structure. The 'index.html' files are replaced manually with
symlinks to the latest versions in the 'apps/' directory.

Use this directory and its contents to test and develop the 'shows', 'show',
'season' and 'episode' apps.
